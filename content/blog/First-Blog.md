Lets Begin downloading python!

## Checking If Python Is Already Downloaded

First, lets check if python is already downloaded on your Windows device.

1. Press the Windows key in bottom left side of your computer's keyboard or on your taskbar at the bottom of your screen.
2. Type `PowerShell`.
3. Click `Enter`.

Next, You will type the following into your command line:

```python
python --version
```

If it responds with an error then you will need to continue to downloading Python. If it returns something similar to `3.x.z`, then you have python downloaded.  

## Download The Official Python Installer

Follow the steps below to download the official python installer from the Python.org site:

    1. Open your browser and navigate to the [download page for Windows](https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/) on Python.org.
    2. Under the `Python Releases for Windows` heading click the link for the `Latest Python 3 Release - Python 3.x.z.`.
    3. Scroll to the bottom and select either `Windows Installer (64-bit)` or `Windows Installer (32-bit)`

When you are done with downloading the installer you can move to the next step.

## Run The Python Installer

Once you have downloaded the installer you should now open it. When you open the installer you will notice at the top under `Install now` that it tells you where python will be downloaded on your computer. You can see this through the path that will look something like this: `C:\Users\Example\Example`. If you do not want your python file to download in this location you can choose the box below named `Customize Installation` which will allow for you to chose where you will download python.

Now when you continue you will be given options in the dialog box that will allow for you to customize the installation to meet your needs. Then you should click `install`. You are now done!

If you happen to forget where you placed your python program you can type the following command into any console:

`where.exe python`

This command will only work if you have installed python correctly onto your user account.
